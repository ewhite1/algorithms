This is my personal study of Algorithms in Swift and JavaScript. Each directory contains a concept I'm working on. I use Swift playgrounds for swift 
and a html + js file for Javascript. 

There is a great advance resources for algorithms in swift at

https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club

and for javaScript check out:
https://github.com/mgechev/javascript-algorithms

for general information about learning algorithms, Khan Academy has a great Resource
